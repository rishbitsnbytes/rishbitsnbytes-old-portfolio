        <h3>What’s this about ? </h3>
        <p>
            When people think of a good tech career or any career for that matter, they usually see good money which is
            fair, satisfaction from their work - an amazing ambition to have not just for work and career but for
            anything, people can’t really be happy unless they are satisfied with their major parts of life. And also,
            they see themselves leading team that creates products which has a huge impact on wider audience – again
            fair. Also, some might think of starting their own business later on after gaining enough expertise in the
            concerned field – again a great ambition to have.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, these could be the few of ambitions but how can a person do that? What could be the driving force of
            achieving all these or any other thing that you want ? Let’s find out….
        </p>

        <h3>The possible forces! </h3>
        <p>
            This blog maybe also be useful to the people stuck in wishful cycle. Wishful Cycle? It’s nothing but just
            people who just wish for their ambitions to be successful but never put efforts for that. Sound silly ? but
            yeah it’s true for many of the people maybe most of the people that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well it can’t be just one driving force for anyone, it’s always a mixed of various things.
        </p>
        <p>

            People may not realise this consciously but subconsciously it’ true. I read a nice book on subconscious mind
            recently, it’s true that we may be hooked to just thinking of one driving force but reality is even our
            little thoughts on daily basis affect our subconscious a lot in terms of mindset and motivation. So, often
            it’s a mixed of our life choices and events that act as a Driving Forces for a good career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forces for us might be that achieving the life people dreamt of, giving happiness and needed comfort to
            family after their so much struggles only for us to be successful and happy, it can also be the money –
            living luxury life, fulfilling luxury dreams, it can also be to create an impact on the society, it can be
            the technical zeal to create some amazing products, to defeat harsh life situations of us and family, to be
            a leader etc…
        </p>

        <h3>The real life story!</h3>
        <p>
            My short story is - Now, I am an aspiring web developer, and an aspiring entrepreneur and a passionate
            teacher, right now pursuing to get an admission in a really good tech-camp! This one - <a href="https://neog.camp/" >https://neog.camp/ </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, I have an educational background, work experience background quite opposite to the field I am
            aspiring for. I have B.Tech in Mechanical Eng., work experience in Sales, Relationship Management, Key
            accounts management. Sounds weird that I want to make such dramatic shift? Maybe Yes, but my ambitions and
            driving forces makes the weirdness go away and make it whole lot interesting. What are those, anyway ? Let’s
            see..
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually, I got in Sales due to some obligations and it’s a lucrative field and I or my family needed that
            badly. However, I have always had a knack for tech stuff especially the computer science and engineering.
            Yes I know you might be thinking why I took Mechanical branch then, well that would be a whole other blog,
            so let’s just call it my educational choice mistake for now. Mistake that I am trying hard to rectify.
            Anyways in today’s high tech dotcom world it’s not impossible, it’s hard but it’s pragmatic. I am also
            aspired to be an entrepreneur and create a significant impact especially in education sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course, a dev job is very very lucrative, impactive, full of scope etc but only if you are really
            good. Also my some harsh circumstances in family. And my passion to become an educator. Tech-Zeal,
            Enthusiasm for Coding, joy of creation etc..
        </p>
        <p>
            So, these are some of my driving forces which are so strong that I do not even need to get myself thinking
            in not netflixing, not gaming etc.. It’s just happen by itself. You don’t any motivation. That’s the power
            of right driving forces.
        </p>

        <h3>Single most important force! </h3>
        <p>
            Recently I have completed levelZero of that tech camp, <a href="https://neog.camp/" >https://neog.camp/ </a>. Done few assignments to be
            qualified for the admission in next levelOne, it was really a good experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, at last the very important driving force which makes me full of technical zeal.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is “The Curiosity”!!
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, it can be the single biggest force which defines your intensity in any field. As they say Curiosity is
            the best teacher you will find in your whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
            In primary and high school people usually get in a habit of hand holding which is not good for the
            curiosity. But, it’s a natural tendency though to be curious to new things and in my personal experience
            science accelerates that a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the covid pandemic we all have learnt very well that Self-Learning is the key to our overall
            development and of course Curiosity will be the charioteer for Self-Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, yes my curiosity toward tech has always kept me connected to dev-tech even after not belonging to the
            field and thus driving me immensely to become and amazing dev.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            So, to conclude, there can be various driving forces in one’s life, one just need to be attentive, be aware
            about oneself, find the right forces and then it will be drive you to be successful in any relevant field.
            On top of it being curious makes it highly catalytic. Everything becomes pragmatic with right driving
            forces.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they say it’s not your fault if you are born poor (not just in terms of money but in terms of skills,
            knowledge, expertise), but it will be your fault if you are dead the same.
